    Namal’s Time Bank intends to achieve three pillars of change namely sustainability, student development, and
    social development. This is achieved through social account and work account which all students are required to
    maintain at the bank. All students of Namal Institute are require to contribute 320 hours every year towards
    community service. Examples of community service include collection of waste, tuition services for school going
    children, plantation drives in the community, etc. Students will need to deposit their hours in the social account.
    Students who are on scholarships are required to contribute additional hours for on-campus and off- campus jobs. The
    hours should be deposited in the work account. Maximum of ", , , , ,

    deposited in the work account which will vary depending on the scholarship granted for each student. For example
    students on 100% scholarship will be required to contribute 320 hours while those on 50% scholarship will be
    required to contribute ", , , , ,

    related to renewable energy, waste recycling, management of farms (olive orchards, vegetable farms, etc.), and other
    projects given by partners and Founding Members of Namal. Another way of looking at Time Bank is to understand that
    students have a maximum of 960 hours which they need to deposit in the bank. These hours can be divided as follows;
    one-third to be spent on community service, one-third on on-campus and off-campus jobs, and remaining one-third
    (i.e.320 hours) can be deposited in the Alumni Scholarship Fund in terms of equivalent rupee value after graduation.
    Contribution in the Alumni Scholarship Fund is not mandatory. Through Time Bank all students are able to learn and
    polish themselves professionally while learning the six Namal values. The Time Bank also greatly benefits the
    society at large while creating an atmosphere of sustainability.", , , , ,

    Networking with industry is an important part of the establishment of Career Placement Office. The office, in
    coordination with Registrar’s office, invites professionals from industry to conduct seminars & workshops
    on current topics. It also holds an Open House/ Job fair to facilitate the industry and the graduating class for
    jobs. Students can seek guidance for a range of support areas from preparing their resume to advice on where to
    circulate their CVs. The faculty is closely involved with the office to maximize the placement of Namal graduates.
