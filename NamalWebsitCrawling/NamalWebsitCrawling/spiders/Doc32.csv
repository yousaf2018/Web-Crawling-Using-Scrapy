				The dam was built by the British Government in 1913 to conserve water coming from numerous streams of water that eventually gave shape to what is now Namal Lake. It was aimed at creating a water resource for irrigating vast tracts of barren land to the western side of Mianwali. For over a century the dam has served as a constant source of precious water for the farmers in the area. It also serves as an exciting excursion point for the tourists as Namal Lake winds through the mountains that make it an attractive point for boating across the lake up to the dam.", , , , ,
